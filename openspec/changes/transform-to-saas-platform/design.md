## Context
The LibreChat project currently provides a basic chat interface. This transformation will convert it into a comprehensive AI SaaS platform with multiple integrated services. The platform needs to support both individual and enterprise users with scalable architecture, multi-language support, and robust monetization features.

## Goals / Non-Goals
### Goals:
- Create a scalable microservices architecture for AI services
- Implement multi-language support (Arabic + English) for chat and voice interaction
- Integrate multiple AI service providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Build a unified user dashboard for all AI tools
- Implement subscription-based billing with multiple tiers
- Ensure security and compliance for SaaS operations
- Support high availability and scalability

### Non-Goals:
- Self-hosting of large language models (initially)
- Custom AI model training capabilities
- Advanced video editing features beyond AI generation
- Real-time collaboration features
- Mobile app development (focus on responsive web)

## Decisions

### Decision: Microservices Architecture
- **What**: Split platform into separate services for each AI capability
- **Why**: Enables independent scaling, easier maintenance, and fault isolation
- **Alternatives**: Monolithic architecture (rejected due to scalability concerns)

### Decision: Container-based Deployment
- **What**: Use Docker containers for all services with Kubernetes orchestration
- **Why**: Consistent deployment, easy scaling, and resource optimization
- **Alternatives**: Serverless functions (rejected due to cost and complexity for AI services)

### Decision: API Gateway Pattern
- **What**: Implement API gateway for routing, authentication, and rate limiting
- **Why**: Centralized security, simplified client interactions, and monitoring
- **Alternatives**: Direct service-to-service communication (rejected due to security concerns)

### Decision: Multi-tenant Database Architecture
- **What**: Shared database with tenant isolation using schema separation
- **Why**: Cost-effective for small tenants while maintaining data isolation
- **Alternatives**: Separate databases per tenant (rejected due to cost complexity)

### Decision: External AI Service Integration
- **What**: Integrate with third-party AI providers rather than self-hosting
- **Why**: Faster time-to-market, access to state-of-the-art models, reduced infrastructure costs
- **Alternatives**: Self-hosted models (rejected due to computational requirements)

### Decision: Stripe for Payment Processing
- **What**: Use Stripe for subscription management and payment processing
- **Why**: Mature API, comprehensive features, and global support
- **Alternatives**: PayPal (rejected due to limited subscription features)

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk: AI Service Reliability
- **Risk**: Dependency on external AI service providers
- **Mitigation**: Implement fallback services, caching, and graceful degradation

### Risk: Cost Management
- **Risk**: High costs from AI service usage and infrastructure
- **Mitigation**: Implement usage quotas, monitoring, and cost optimization strategies

### Risk: Multi-language Support Complexity
- **Risk**: Arabic language support requires specialized handling
- **Mitigation**: Use specialized libraries and native Arabic speakers for testing

### Risk: Performance with Multiple Services
- **Risk**: Latency from multiple service calls
- **Mitigation**: Implement caching, async processing, and service optimization

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Weeks 1-2)
- Deploy new microservices architecture
- Set up authentication and user management
- Configure database and storage systems

### Phase 2: Core Services (Weeks 3-6)
- Migrate existing chat functionality
- Implement new AI services (image, video, code generation)
- Build dashboard interface

### Phase 3: Monetization (Weeks 7-8)
- Implement subscription management
- Set up payment processing
- Add usage tracking and analytics

### Phase 4: Testing and Launch (Weeks 9-10)
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance optimization
- Beta release with limited users
- Full public launch

### Rollback Strategy
- Maintain backup of existing LibreChat instance
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Prepare rollback scripts for each service

## Open Questions
1. Which AI service providers to prioritize for integration?
2. What should be the pricing structure for different subscription tiers?
3. How to handle data privacy and compliance requirements for different regions?
4. What level of customization should be allowed for AI-generated content?
5. How to implement usage limits and fair usage policies?
